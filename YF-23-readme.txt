YF23 yasim readme.

This is not an authentic representation of a YF23 but it's based
on the right numbers, where I could find them.  There is a lot of
guesswork in the fdm.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Purely out of curiosity, I've linked the rudder
control input to the elevators and the ailerons - with some slick
joystick manipulation it's possible to fly the a/c on a considerably
off-axis bearing.  However, a lot more work needs doing before it
could be considered 'usable'.

The model was originally constructed in Realsoft3D (linux beta
V4.5), exported as a .OBJ format file and imported into AC3D where
it was converted into .ac format and textured.

Most of the panel instruments are direct or hacked copies of the
standard instruments that come with FG.  Same with the Huds.

The sound samples are a direct copy of the a4 sounds and the sound
config is a modified version of the a4 sound config.

The Autopilot is still in development.
